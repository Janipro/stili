# Discussion points

This file will be used to document changes in the group contract, relfections regarding our coding progress and other points included in L3.

- changed our database from mySQL to SQLite because it is filebased compared to server/client based, which will be simpler to implement
- possibly use vscode as the only IDE
- Combining issues B9-ShowUserInformation and B9-CreateProfile due to their very similar nature, we have combined them to one common ux focused development task.
